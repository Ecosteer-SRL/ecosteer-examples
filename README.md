# ecosteer-examples

The first example is found in sensor_stream directory, which contains a Python program that publishes real CO2 data points on an MQTT broker.

Two versions of the program are provided:
- sensor.py: a base implementation, without DVCO capabilities
- dvco_sensor.py: an upgraded implementation of sensor.py, that contains the necessary calls to the DVCO pub stack primitives and dopifies the data streams

The difference between these two programs is used to show how a general purpose data stream can be integrated with the DVCO pub stack.

The sensor_stream directory contains the following subdirectories: 
- common: collects modules shared between multiple classes in the project
- dvco_stub: contains a stub implementation of the DVCO publisher stack, useful to show how a general purpose program can be integrated with the DVCO pub stack and become a DVCO-enabled publisher
- externals: contains the code for reading CO2 data 
- sensor: contains the two versions of the program, sensor.py and dvco_sensor.py. As the dvco_sensor.py uses a stub implementation of the pub stack, the dopified data corresponds to the input data. This folder also contains a package, mqtt_output.py, which offers a client implementation that wraps mqtt paho client. 


# CO2 SENSOR 

Sensor: TFA Monitor DE CO2 DOSTMANN AIRCO2NTROL Mini 1.5006, 31.5006.02

The CO2Meter implementation thankfully provided by Michael Nosthoff in https://github.com/heinemml/CO2Meter was adapted for this project. 


# INSTALLATION

Connect the USB sensor to a Linux computer, such as an Ubuntu 18 or 
to a Raspberry Pi Zero W board. It should be listed by inserting the following command: 
```
> lsusb
```
The output should contain the following entry:  
```
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 04d9:a052 Holtek Semiconductor, Inc. USB-zyTemp
```
The hexadecimal ID contains four digits:   
- the first two (0x04d9) indicate the vendor id;  
- the last two (0xa052) indicathe the product id.  

You can also check the product with the online search engine: https://www.the-sz.com/products/usbid/index.php?


The default driver for USB in linux is HIDRAW. 
```
> ls /dev/
```
There should be two entries, hidraw0 and hidraw1.  
Please note that the /dev/hidraw0 can be used by other devices as well and it cannot be accessed without
root privileges. In order to avoid this issue create a file called 90-co2mini.rules in the folder /etc/udev/rules.d.

```
> touch /etc/udev/rules.d/90-co2mini.rules
```
It should contain the following contents:
```
ACTION=="remove", GOTO="co2mini_end"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="a052", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0660", SYMLINK+="co2mini%n", GOTO="co2mini_end"
LABEL="co2mini_end"
```
The file instructs the OS to create a simlink called co2mini%n, where %n is a auto incrementing number, for any USB with vendor id 04d9 and product id a052. The mask is 0660, which means that the file /dev/co2mini%n can be accessed by any user in the plugdev group. On debian systems, plugdev is a system group and the user you are using to ssh into the device should belong to the group. Check that plugdev is listed in your groups:
```
groups
```
Alternatively, if you are using an Ubuntu system that does not have the plugdev group, you can set the mode to 0666 in the above code snippet (MODE="0666") and you will be able to access the device with any user. 

Now, every time the sensor will be re-connected to the computer it will be listed as co2mini%n in /dev directory. The entry needs to be passed as a configuration to CO2Meter.


## SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES

- Python version 3.9.10  
- paho-mqtt version 1.6.1  

The paho-mqtt package can be installed in a virtualenv:
```
> cd ${HOME}
> mkdir -p virtualenv
> cd virtualenv
> python3.9 -m venv dop 
> source dop/bin/activate
> pip install wheel
> pip install paho-mqtt 
```

## INSTALL PROJECT AND RUN

Clone this repo in a local folder called ecosteer_examples/sensor_stream. 

To run the sensor program:
```
> source ~/virtualenv/dop/bin/activate
> cd ${HOME}/ecosteer_examples/sensor_stream/sensor
> source env.sh 
> python sensor.py -c ${PATH_TO_CURRENT_DIRECTORY}/sensors_co2_mosq.yaml
```
The env.sh file contains PYTHONPATH environmental variable that should indicate the path to the sensor_stream directory.  

In order to run the dvco_sensor program the steps are similar. This will dopify the data by using the stub implementation of the DVCO pub stack, and will publish it by using the callback installed on the stack.  
```
> source ~/virtualenv/dop/bin/activate
> cd ${HOME}/ecosteer_examples/sensor_stream/sensor
> source env.sh 
> python dvco_sensor.py -c ${PATH_TO_CURRENT_DIRECTORY}/sensors_co2_mosq.yaml -p product.json
``` 


### IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The class MqttClient offers an implementation of a client for MQTT protocol to be used to publish data. 
Its write() method is not thread-safe, so the access to it needs to be synchronized in a multi-threaded environment. 

The sensor program uses this method in a single thread, which is responsible for reading and publishing sensor data, and therefore no synchronization is implemented. 

In the DVCO-instrumented implementation of the sensor program, this write() method of MqttClient is called inside the function used as the data callback by the DVCO stack. In this specific implementation, the callback (and thus the method write()) is solely called by the DVCO stack stub implementation, therefore the synchronization implemented by the DVCO stack provides the proper thread safety. If, instead, the function used as the data callback is used by threads that are not solely under the control of the DVCO-stack â€“ then the same function has to be responsible for the necessary synchronization, as the DVCO-stack cannot be aware of all the threads firing the same function.
